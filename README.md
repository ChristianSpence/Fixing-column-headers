# Fixing-column-headers
A short function in R which repairs Excel file imports where column headers are both spread over multiple rows and/or include merged cells.

`tidy_column_names(df, name_rows, first_data_row = NULL, sep = " ", drop_name_rows = TRUE)`

`df` must be a data frame

`name_rows` should be an integer vector which specifies the row numbers in which all column header information exists

`first_data_row` defaults to the row below the largest integer in `name_rows`

`sep` defines what should separate each individual value in combined header texts

`drop_name_rows` by default removes all rows named in `named_rows` and also rows up to but not including `first_data_row`
